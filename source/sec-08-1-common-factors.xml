		In the previous section, we learned how to multiply polynomials. In this section, we are going to start to learn
		how to undo everything we just did. 
	</p>
	<p>
		We will begin the process by looking at a basic grid product from the previous section. We started with values
		around the edges of the grid and used that information to tell us the values inside of the grid.

		There is nothing mathematically wrong with any of these products. But we can see that some choices are better
		than others. The choice on the far left doesn't accomplish anything at all. The one on the far right introduces
		fractions. So we really want to focus on the middle two. 
	</p>
	<aside>
		<p>
			There's also nothing wrong with fractions. But there are certainly times when we prefer not to work with
			them. 
		</p>
	</aside>
	<p>
		Of the middle two options, the one on the right can be understood as being the "better" option. The reason for
		that is that we factored out the biggest amount possible. And that is the basic goal. Technically, we call this
		the greatest common factor.

		A slightly more complex version of this concept is known as factoring by grouping. The idea here is that we're
		going to factor out the greatest common factor of two pairs of terms, then we're going to look at the new terms
		you've created and see if there's something to factor out there. But this requires us to expand our concept of
		what a common factor can be. 
	</p>
	<p>
		To visualize this, we will look at a specific example through a substitution.

		The key to understanding this is that we can treat terms inside of parentheses as if they were a single object
		when we're factoring. As long as the objects in the parentheses are identical, we can factor them out like any
		other variable.

		<title>Factor by Grouping with Negatives</title>
		<p>
			It is very important to be careful with negative signs, especially when the negative sign is the third term
			of the polynomial. Students will sometimes make unfortunate groupings that are incorrect.
			<me>
				x^2 + 4x - 2x - 8 \overset{\times}{=} (x^2 + 4x) - (2x - 8)

				Can you identify the error?

		</aside>
		<p>
			When thinking about the factorization, it is important to keep the signs with the corresponding terms when
			you visualize the grid.
