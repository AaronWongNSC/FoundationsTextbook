				Earlier in the section, there was a warning about adding and subtracting in columns when working with

				fully understand the challenges that arise from working in columns.

				There is a "rule" that can be used for doing this calculation in columns. To calculate <m>-a + b</m>
				(where and are positive numbers). 
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							Step 1: Identify the larger number. 
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Step 2: Perform the calculation "larger minus smaller." 
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Step 3: Give your result the same sign as the larger number in the original problem. 
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				Apply this "rule" to the calculation <m>-53 + 27</m>. Explain how this "rule" is a more complicated

		<title>Worksheet 5</title>
		<exercise>
			<p>
				In the previous worksheet, we saw that calculations in columns can be problematic and lead to errors.
				The "rule" that was provided is the common way that this is taught. But this is not the only way to
				think about doing this calculation in columns. We're going to explore this in a different way. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Rather than working with digits, we will work with values. We will look at the calculation
				<m>-53 + 27</m> again, but rewriting the calculations using expanded form. From here, it is much easier
				to perform the calculation while avoiding errors.

				What this is showing is that the calculation can be performed if we focus on individual place values.
				Upon a deeper investigation, this would also reveal that the real issue comes down to the steps of
				"carrying the one" or "borrowing." The digit manipulations that one might normally do are incompatible
				with the algorithms for addition or subtraction in columns. Here are two of the most reasonable attempts
				at performing this calculation using the traditional algorithms.
