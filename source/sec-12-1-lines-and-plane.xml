		In <xref ref="def-solve-solution"/>, we saw that solving an equation means to find the value (or values) of the variable
		(or variables) that make the equation true, and that solutions are the specific values of the variables that
		accomplish that. We are going to take another look at those ideas, but in the context of using multiple
		variables simultaneously. Specifically, we are going to be working with linear equations in the variables
		<m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.

		Long lists of ordered pairs are not the most intuitive way to present solutions. For more than just a couple
		points, it makes sense to transition to using a chart, such as the one in the margin. Sometimes a chart like
		this can help us see a pattern in the numbers if the pattern is simple. But even with that, charts have limited
		value because it's still just a list of numbers. It would be better to use a more visual representation of this
		information.

		Mathematicians often use a coordinate plane to represent solutions to two variable equations. The coordinate
		plane is a picture where specific positions represent specific ordered pairs. Most students are familiar with
		the basic design of the standard rectangular coordinate grid, which is the grid we will be using.

		Here is a quick reminder of some of the basic terminology: 
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					The labeled horizontal line is called the <m>x</m>-axis
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					The labeled vertical line is called the <m>y</m>-axis
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					The intersection of those two lines is called the origin. 
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					The quadrants are numbered with capital roman numerals, starting with I on the upper right and
					working around in a counter-clockwise manner. 
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		Students often learn coordinates as a sequence of motions starting from the origin. The point <m>(2,3)</m> is
		located by starting from the origin, moving right 2, and then moving up 3. Negative <m>x</m>-coordinates
		correspond to moving to the left instead of to the right, and negative <m>y</m>-coordinates correspond to moving
		down instead of up.

		But there is another way to look at this which is a little bit more general. Rather than thinking about this in
		terms of movement, we can think about this in terms of the intersection of two lines. Lines of the form
		<m>x = \text{(Number)}</m> are vertical lines corresponding to the coordinates on the <m>x</m>-axis and lines of
		the form <m>y = \text{(Number)}</m> are horizontal lines corresponding to the coordinates on the <m>y</m>-axis.
		It is the overlap of these lines that creates the coordinate grid. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Once you have this, then you can see that the positions are actually the intersection of two of these lines,
		corresponding to the specific value and the specific value. Here are the two ways of interpreting the point
		<m>(x,y) = (2,3)</m> visualized side-by-side.

		We can generalize the idea of giving locations as the intersection of two lines by allowing ourselves to use
		curves. For example, locations on the earth are found as the intersection of the latitude and longitude lines
		(which are actually curves on the globe). Your location in a city can often be described as being near the
		intersection of two streets (which may not be straight). In trigonometry, there's another coordinate grid that's
		built around circles and lines pointing out from the origin called polar coordinates.

		Once we have the ability to locate points on the coordinate plane, we can then plot lots of points on the same
		coordinate grid and look for a pattern.
