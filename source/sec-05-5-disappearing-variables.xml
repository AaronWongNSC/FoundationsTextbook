	<title>Going Deeper: Disappearing Variables</title>
	<p>
		In all the equations that we've solved so far, it has always been the case that the last line of work has given
		us a specific number or expression for the variable of interest. Let's look at solving the equation
		<m>3x + 7 = -2</m>. 
		<me>
			\begin{aligned}
				3x + 7 \amp = -2 \\
				3x \amp = -9 \amp \eqnspacer \amp \text{Subtract $7$ from both sides} \\
				x \amp = -3 \amp \amp \text{Divide both sides by $3$} \\
			\end{aligned}
		</me>
		We have been interpreting the last line as telling us that when <m>x = -3</m>, the original equation is true. We
		can even check this by explicit substitution. 
		<me>
			\begin{aligned}
				3x + 7 \amp = - 2 \\
				3(-3) + 7 \amp \overset{?}{=} -2 \amp \eqnspacer \amp \text{Substitute $x = -3$} \\
				-2 \amp \overset{\checkmark}{=} -2 \\
			\end{aligned}
		</me>
	</p>
	<aside>
		<p>
			We use <m>\overset{?}{=}</m> to ask whether the two sides are equal to each other after a substitution. At
			the end of the calculation, we will replace it with <m>\overset{\checkmark}{=}</m> if it is and with
			<m>\neq</m> if it is not. 
		</p>
	</aside>
	<p>
		But what happens when the variable disappears? Consider the following attempt at solving an equation: 
		<me>
			\begin{aligned}
				3(x + 2) + 5 \amp = 3x + 7 \\
				3x + 6 + 5 \amp = 3x + 7 \amp \eqnspacer \amp \text{Distribute} \\
				3x + 11 \amp = 3x + 7 \amp \amp \text{Arithmetic} \\
				11 \amp = 7 \amp \amp \text{Subtract $3x$ from both sides} 
			\end{aligned}
		</me>
		How can we interpret the this? The first thing to observe is that the equation is false. The numbers 11 and 7
		are definitely not the same.
	</p>
	<aside>
		<p>
			We could also say that the solution set is <m>\emptyset</m>.
		</p>
	</aside>
	<p>
		What this is telling us is that there are no values of the variable that make the equation true. The equation
		will always be false, no matter what value we choose the variable to be. A concise way of saying this is to say
		that there are no solutions to the equation. We can pick some values of and check this.

			Notice that the values we're getting in these calculations are not the 11 and 7 that we got above. Notice
			how we subtracted from both sides of the equation in the last step. What would happen to our values if we
			also did that here? 
		</p>
	</aside>
	<p>
		Here is something else that may happen: 
		<me>
			\begin{aligned}
				2(2x - 1) + 3 \amp = 4(x + 1) - 3 \\
				4x - 2 + 3 \amp = 4x + 4 - 3 \amp \eqnspacer \amp \text{Distribute} \\
				4x + 1 \amp = 4x + 1 \amp \amp \text{Arithmetic} \\
				1 \amp = 1 \amp \amp \text{Subtract $4x$ from both sides} 
			\end{aligned}
		</me>
		Once again, the variable disappeared. But this time, we have a true equation. What this means is that regardless
		of the value of the variable, the equation will always be true. A shorter way of saying that is that can be any
		real number. We will check a few examples to demonstrate this.

					\underline{x = 1} \\

		As we continue with various types of algebraic calculations and manipulations, there will be other times when a
		variable will be missing from an equation or an expression. For example, consider the following: Substitute
		<m>x = 4</m> and <m>y = 2</m> into the expression <m>2x - 7</m>. The substitution into the <m>x</m> term is
		clear, but what does it mean to substitute for when there is no <m>y</m> variable? 
	</p>
	<p>
		The insight comes from looking at our calculations above. What caused the variable terms to disappear? It's both
		obvious and subtle at the same time. In the last step, we subtracted off a certain quantity that caused the
		variable terms to cancel out. Let's break that down more carefully:
	</p>
	<aside>
		<p>
			We are expanding the very last step of the <m>2(2x-1) + 3 = 4(x+1) - 3</m> calculation. 
		</p>
	</aside>
	<p>
		<me>
			\begin{aligned}
				4x + 1 \amp = 4x + 1 \\
				(4x + 1) - 4x \amp = (4x + 1) - 4x \amp \eqnspacer \amp \text{Subtract $4x$ from both sides} \\
				4x - 4x + 1 \amp = 4x - 4x + 1 \amp \amp \text{Rearrange the terms} \\
				(4 - 4)x + 1 \amp = (4 - 4)x + 1 \amp \amp \text{Group and factor out the $x$} \\
				0x + 1 \amp = 0x + 1 \amp \amp \text{Arithmetic} \\
				0 + 1 \amp = 0 + 1 \amp \amp \text{Arithmetic} \\
				1 \amp = 1 \amp \amp \text{Arithmetic} \\
			\end{aligned}
		</me>
		The last two arithmetic steps are what cause the variable term to go away. We're using the fact that zero
		multiplied by any number is zero and that zero added to any number does not change the value. And by these
		observations, we are explaining why it makes sense for us to simplify the expression so that the variable is not
		shown. But this does not say that the variable doesn't exist anymore. In some sense, the term is still there.
		We're just not bothering to write it down because it doesn't have any impact on the quantity being expressed. 
	</p>
	<aside>
		<p>
			You can also think of it as a <m>0y^2</m> term or even terms like <m>0xy</m>. As long as the coefficient of
			the monomial is zero, that term can be dropped. 
		</p>
	</aside>
	<p>
		And that brings us back to the two-variable substitution. Even though we're only writing <m>2x - 7</m>, you
		should really be thinking about it as something like <m>2x + 0y - 7</m>. We say that the expression
		<m>2x - 7</m> is \emph{independent of the variable and that simply means that changing the value of has no
		impact on the value of the expression. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The first place that students run into this is when we define functions. For example, let's say we define the
		function <m>f(x) = 4</m>. What is <m>f(2)</m>? We know that this means we're supposed to plug in 2 for <m>x</m>
		but there are no <m>x</m> variables anywhere. The expression is independent of and so <m>f(x) = 4</m> regardless
		of what value of <m>x</m> is chosen. 
	</p>
	<p>
		This may seem like a small point, but the concept of functions or other expressions being independent of certain
		variables comes up regularly in both pure and applied mathematical settings. So it's helpful to understand this
		idea sooner rather than later.
