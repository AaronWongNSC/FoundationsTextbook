	<title>Closing Ideas</title>
	<p>
		We have reached the end of the exploration of addition and subtraction. We have covered a variety of ways of
		thinking about those mathematical operations. Remember that the point is not that you need to use all of these
		ideas all of the time, but rather that having that diverse toolbox of ideas and approaches will give you more
		flexibility to solve problem you come across in the future.

		Many students think of math as a set of rules that you need to follow, rather than a diverse set of concepts
		that are related to each other. That conceptual diversity in many ways reflects the diversity of students.
		Different students come to mathematics with different experiences and intuitions. Perhaps one student finds the
		movement diagrams easier to understand while another student thinks that blocks are easiest. It doesn't really
		matter that much. The goal is for students to come to their own experience of understanding of mathematical
		thinking and the diversity of approaches in the last several sections helps to reflect the diversity of
		perspectives that exist within mathematical reasoning.

		We'll close this section with a very important note. If you find one way of looking at something to be difficult
		to understand, that's usually a signal to probe more deeply into it. It's not a signal that you should simply do
		something else. It is far better to take an intellectual posture that seeks to understand rather than seeks to
		not understand. Having a broader understanding of ideas only stands to benefit you. Maybe you will eventually
		understand it, or maybe not. But if you don't try, you definitely won't.
