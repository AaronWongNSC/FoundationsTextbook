				equations. For example, we can use our movement diagram to visualize the equation <m>2 + x = 6</m>:

				You can think of this as two rulers. To represent <m>a + b</m>, slide the top ruler over by spaces, then

			Although this may seem like an artificial construction, this idea basically mimics the way that calculations
			were done with slide rules. Unfortunately, there is one piece missing, which is the application of
			logarithms. And logarithms go beyond the scope of this course. But one of the core features of logarithms is
			that it converts multiplication into addition. And that is the trick that makes slide rules work. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Slide rules have been replaced by calculators, but it's of historical interest that slide rules were the
			calculators of their day, which spanned from the early 1600s through the mid-1900s. Slide rules were phased
			out during the 1970s when pocket calculators started to become cheap enough for the average person to be
			able to purchase one.

				We've considered arithmetic as movement on the number line. But it turns out that we can do the same
				thing on the coordinate plane. But rather than using a single number, we use a pair of numbers to
				indicate motion in the horizontal and vertical directions. Here are a couple different vectors. 
			</p>
			<aside>
				<p>
					Notice the use of pointed brackets instead of round brackets. This is how we distinguish points from vectors.

					Remember that the result is the final result of all the movement. What would the arrow look like if

				In the same way that addition with a movement diagram was simply doing one movement followed by another
				one, addition of vectors can be thought of as doing one movement followed by another one. With this
				concept in mind, sketch a picture of <m>\langle 2, 3 \rangle + \langle -4, -2 \rangle</m> on the grid
				and then compute the result.
