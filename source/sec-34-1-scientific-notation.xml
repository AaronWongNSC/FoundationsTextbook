		In science courses, there are important values that are sometimes very large or very small. For example, in a
		course such as astronomy, you might learn that the average distance from the earth to the sun is approximately
		149600000000 meters. In chemistry, you will run into a unit called a mole, which represents approximately
		60221407600000000000000 molecules. You might also have very small numbers, such as atoms being approximately
		0.0000000001 meters in size. 
	</p>
	<p>
		One of the challenges with numbers like these is that it can be very difficult to compare them. For example,
		determine which of the two numbers is the larger number: 10000000000000000000 or 5000000000000000000. It can be
		an annoying and frustrating process to have to count out all of the digits in those numbers, and it's easy to
		make mistakes. Some people will use commas or small spaces every three digits (starting from the decimal point)
		in order to help, but this is still a lot of writing and a lot of opportunities for errors. 
	</p>
	<aside>
		<p>
			Another way this is address is by making up new words. No, this is not a joke. 
		</p>
	</aside>
	<p>
		This is addressed in multiple ways. We are going to focus on scientific notation in this section. The idea of
		scientific notation is to take these long numbers and write them in a more compact form that makes them easier
		to think about and easier to work with. 
	</p>
	<aside>
		<p>
			We will be using <m>\times</m> instead of <m>\cdot</m> to avoid confusion as there will be many decimals in this section.

				<term>Scientific notation</term> is a representation of numbers (that are typically very large or very
				small) using the form <m>a \times 10^n</m>, where <m>a</m> is a decimal number between 1 and 10

		The value of scientific notation is that it replaces the process of counting out zeros and displays that value
		explicitly. It comes out of the fact that multiplying or dividing a number by a power of corresponds to "moving
		the decimal point" a certain number of places.

			The idea of "moving the decimal point" is extremely common when performing these arithmetic calculations.
			This idea is just a reflection of the fact that we work with a system for writing down numbers. When

		<title>Converting to Scientific Notation</title>
		<p>
			Putting a number into scientific notation follows the same idea. However, in this case you must decide the
			number of positions that the decimal point must move. Some people say that the signs are "switched" when
			putting the number into scientific notation, but that tends to cause confusion because students often forget
			which way the correct way is and so when they "switch" they still get it wrong. The best way to avoid errors
			is simply to take a moment and think about the final answer. If you started with a big number, then your
			scientific notation should represent a big number. And if you started with a small number, your scientific
			notation should represent a small number. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The other important factor to remember is that your value should be a number between and but not itself.
			Another way to think about it is that you only want one digit to the left of the decimal point (and that
			digit should not be zero) when you're done.

		Another reason for scientific notation is that it allows us to more easily perform arithmetic. The product
		<m>2000000000 \cdot 400000000000</m> is definitely an 8 followed by some number of zeros, but counting those
		zeros runs into the same risks of errors as we saw above.

		<title>Multiplication in Scientific Notation</title>
		<p>
			To perform arithmetic with scientific notation correctly, it is helpful to think about some basic algebra
			ideas. Instead of thinking about <m>a \times 10^n</m>, it can be more helpful to think about
			<m>a \times x^n</m> where <m>x = 10</m>. The benefit to this is that it allows you to use your past
			experience and intuition. 
		</p>
		<p>
			We'll start with multiplication. What is <m>2x^7 \cdot 3x^9</m>? You might recall that we multiply the
			number parts and then multiply the variable parts, and that the variable parts satisfy
			<m>x^n \cdot x^m = x^{n+m}</m>, which gives you as the final result.

		<title>Adding and Subtracting with Scientific Notation</title>
		<p>
			When adding and subtracting using scientific notation, you need to be a bit more careful. We need to have
			like terms in order for us to combine them. For example, <m>6x^8 + 2x^7</m> cannot be simplified. In order
			to get around this, we need to rewrite the numbers so that they have the same power of 10.
		</p>
		<aside>
			<p>
				Technically, these representations are not scientific notation. But it doesn't actually matter what your
				intermediate steps are as long as your final answer is in scientific notation. 
			</p>
		</aside>
		<p>
			In order to do that, we need to think about other representations of numbers. Here is a collection of
			expressions that are all equivalent to
			<me>
				5000 = 5000 \times 10^0 = 500 \times 10^1 = 50 \times 10^2 = 5 \times 10^3 = 0.5 \times 10^4 = 0.05 \times 10^5 = \cdots
			</me>
			The important feature to notice is that as the power of increases, the other number decreases. This
			balancing act makes sense if you think about the overall result. If the overall result is not going to
			change, then if one number of the product gets larger, the other must get smaller. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Once that pattern is recognized, the calculations are simply a matter of execution. Here are two common
			approaches to the same calculation. 
			<me>
				\begin{aligned}
					(6 \times 10^8) + (2 \times 10^7) \amp = (6 \times 10^8) + (0.2 \times 10^8) \\
					\amp = 6.2 \times 10^8 
				\end{aligned}
			</me>
			And here is the second: 
			<me>
				\begin{aligned}
					(6 \times 10^8) + (2 \times 10^7) \amp = (6 \times 10^8) + (0.2 \times 10^8) \\
					\amp = 6.2 \times 10^8 
				\end{aligned}

			Some prefer this first way because it avoids decimals. Some prefer the second way because it's shorter. It
			doesn't matter which way you do it as long as your steps are valid.
