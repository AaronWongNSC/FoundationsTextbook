	<title>Going Deeper: Subtraction as Displacement</title>
	<p>
		In Worksheet 3 of this section, we looked at the idea of using subtraction to measure distance. We're going to
		push that idea further and look at the signed distance between numbers, and see some applications of the idea. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Let's look at the calculation <m>5 - 3 = 2</m>. Using motion on the number line, we can interpret this as
		starting at 5 and moving 3 to the left to get to 2.
	</p>

						Step 1: Start at 5.

				<li>

						Step 2: Move 3 spaces to the left. 
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Step 3: End up at 2.

		However, we can get another interpretation of this by inverting the movement and turning it into a question: If
		we're starting at 2 and ending up at 5, what is the movement that we must make? And by looking at the picture,
		we can see that we need to move 3 to the right.

		<idx><h>displacement</h></idx>
		<term>Displacement</term> is the movement from one position to another, and it can be expressed in terms of
		subtraction. To move from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m> the required displacement is <m>b - a</m>. We can check this
		algebraically:
		<me>
			\underbrace{a}_{\text{start}} + \underbrace{(b - a)}_{\text{displacement}} = \underbrace{b}_{\text{end}}
		</me>
		This concept gets applied in a number of ways at many different levels of mathematics. 
	</p>
	<p>
		In <xref ref="sec-sif-1-main" />, we looked at the concept of slope. The main definition we presented was purely
		geometric:
		<me>
			m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{\text{Rise}}{\text{Run}} = \frac{\text{The change of $y$}}{\text{The change of $x$}}
		</me>
		We're going to take a closer look at this idea through the lens of displacement to understand the algebraic
		formula for slope.

		Notice that both <m>\Delta x</m> and <m>\Delta y</m> can be interpreted as displacements. They describe a motion
		to get from one location to another. Furthermore, these two displacements are independent of each other, meaning
		that as we change our <m>x</m>-coordinate the <m>y</m>-coordainte is fixed, and the same is true the other way
		around. In fact, we can look at both of these displacements relative to the corresponding axes:

		By viewing the movements in this way, we can see that we are looking at displacement on the number line, and can
		use the formula for displacement for each to get the algebraic formula for slope:
		<me>
			m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}.
		</me>
		This formula was given in a margin comment (<xref ref="sec-sif-1-main" text="title"/>), but we didn't
		explain it at the time because the focus was on the geometric interpretation and building basic intuition and
		experience. But now that we have the concept of displacement, this formula is not as mysterious. 
	</p>
	<p>
		As you continue forward in mathematics (and also science and statistics classes), you will see lots of
		situations where subtraction is being used to represent a quantity like acts like a displacement (though the
		language will vary depending on the topic). More generally, these concepts appear in vectors, which can be used
		to represent displacement in multiple dimensions. The following are a few examples of this. Don't worry if you
		don't understand these, as they're not relevant to this class. But if you've seen them before, it will help you
		to put this idea into context.
