		Things get a bit more complicated when we start introducing decimals into fractions. The basic concept of
		thinking about fractions as division still applies, but it becomes more difficult to create diagrams. 
	</p>
	<aside>
		<p>
			And fractions inside of fractions is even more complicated.

		Consider the fraction <m>\frac{6.37}{1.32}</m> This is asking "how many groups of size 1.32 can be made if you
		have 6.37 items?" Conceptually, it makes sense, and we can come up with some basic analogies to help us think
		through it, such as "How many items can you buy for \$1.32 if you only have \$6.37 to spend?" 
	</p>
	<p>
		While we really can't draw an effective parts of a whole diagram for this problem, it's possible to set this up
		with a number line diagram to represent division. And we can push forward with manipulating the symbols the same
		way we did for fractions.

			We basically never write mixed numbers with decimals. That one is there just to emphasize that the ideas are
			the same.

	</aside>
	<p>
		In real life, we usually reach for a calculator for fractions involving decimals. We invented the technology
		precisely to help us with those situations. But this doesn't negate the importance of having a conceptual
		foundation. While calculators can give us numerical results, it does not have the ability to conceptualize the
		idea of a fraction. 
	</p>
	<p>
		In this section, we used the intuition of "parts of a whole" with integer values to develop a pattern for
		manipulating fractions with variables. But we did not use any diagrams to try to represent those fractions.
		The reason is that our diagrams basically fall apart on us. Here are how different the pictures can look
		depending on the value of the variable:

			Learning to trust yourself with algebra is a key step, but it can be very difficult if you've spent many
			years struggling with it. It's kind of like removing training wheels from a bike. Losing confidence and
			thinking about falling over can lead to falling over. It takes time and practice (and sometimes a certain
			number of failures) to build up confidence. But it can be done.

		The absence of concrete images makes fraction manipulations very abstract when we start involving variables. And
		this is where algebraic fluency really needs to kick in. As we go through the next few sections, we will be
		continuing to explore fractions. While we will be primarily working in the context of integer fractions, it is
		important to keep in mind that the algebraic processes that we're developing can also be applied to variable
		fractions, and you will have to trust your algebraic fluency more and more as you get further along.
