		We have seen that we can solve systems of linear equations using substitution, but that one of the challenges of
		this method was the computational problem of manipulating fractions. The method of elimination is another
		approach to solving systems of equations that mostly sidesteps the issue (at least at this level), which often
		makes it a more efficient approach. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The core concept of this method is a slightly different use of axioms of equality that were introduced in
		<xref ref="sec-bap-1-main"/> mixed in with a substitution. We can add the same value to both sides of an
		equation without losing the equality. The only twist is that we use two different representations in the
		addition step. Here is how it looks: 
		<me>
			\text{If $a = b$ and $c = d$, then $a + c = b + d$.}
		</me>
	</p>
	<p>
		The challenge is to find useful equations so that adding the equations together gives a helpful result. Here are
		two examples to compare:

		First, notice that the addition in columns is simply an organizational tool. By putting like terms together, it
		simplifies the process of combining them and avoids errors. Second, notice that the final equation on the right
		only has one variable even though the two initial equations had two variables. The goal of the method of
		elimination is to eliminate one of the variables. This allows you to solve for the remaining variable.

		<title>Solving a System by Elimination (Part 2)</title>
		<p>
			Not all systems of equations are in a form that immediately lends itself to the method of elimination. Let's
			take another look at the example on the left from earlier:
			<me>
				\left\{
					\begin{array}{rcrcr}
						2x \amp + \amp 3y \amp = \amp 3 \\
						3x \amp + \amp 2y \amp = \amp 5 \\
					\end{array}
				\right.
			</me> 
		</p>
		<p>
			If we add these equations together directly, nothing will cancel out. But we can multiply either equation by
			any non-zero number to change its form. And if this is done correctly, it will lead to cancellation.

	<p>
		There's no real "trick" to figuring out the numbers that you need to get the terms to cancel, but there is a
		general heuristic. Once you've identified the variable you want to eliminate, find the least common multiple of
		the coefficients, and multiply the equations by the appropriate value to make match, and then make sure that the
		signs are opposite each other. While some instructors suggest that you can "subtract" the equations, this ends
		up causing a lot of computational errors, and so it's usually better to use addition.

	<aside>

			There's nothing algebraically wrong with subtracting one equation from another. The problem is that it leads
			to mistakes in the execution that can otherwise be avoided.
