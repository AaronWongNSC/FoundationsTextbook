		Many students will say that they sometimes "forget" how to do arithmetic with fractions. This often results from
		viewing fractions as purely a collection of symbols with particular rules for how to manipulate them. Their
		forgetfulness sometimes leads them to guess at how to work with fractions. Here are some examples:
		<me>
			\begin{array}{ccc}
    			\dfrac{3}{5} + \dfrac{8}{5} \overset{\times}{=} \dfrac{3 + 8}{5 + 5} = \dfrac{11}{10}
					\amp \qquad \qquad \amp
					\dfrac{2}{5} + \dfrac{5}{6} \overset{\times}{=} \dfrac{2 + 5}{5 \cdot 6} = \dfrac{7}{30} \\ \\
			    \dfrac{4}{5} - \dfrac{1}{3} \overset{\times}{=} \dfrac{4 - 1}{5 - 3} = \dfrac{3}{2}
					\amp \qquad \qquad \amp
					\hspace{2cm} \dfrac{3}{5} - \dfrac{1}{3} \overset{\times}{=} \dfrac{3 - 1}{5 \cdot 3} = \dfrac{2}{15}
			\end{array}

			Of course, focusing on a mathematical understanding doesn't mean that incorrect calculations are acceptable.

	<p>
		It's not enough to simply identify that these calculations are incorrect. We have been emphasizing the
		importance of mathematical reasoning throughout this book. Mathematical reasoning goes beyond simply pointing at
		some rules and saying that they weren't properly followed. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Let's take a step back and just think about some basic addition and subtraction. What do we mean by
		<m>2 + 3</m>? There are several ways to think about it, but the one most people think about first is that you
		are combining two collections of objects:

		The basic challenge of this is that the pieces are different sizes, so it doesn't really make sense to combine

        <idx><h>common denominator</h></idx>
		A "common denominator" is simply a choice of a denominator that works well with the fractions. Mathematically,
		this means that the chosen denominator is a common multiple of the denominators you're working with. Ideally,
		we would use the least common denominator, but if a larger denominator is chosen, the arithmetic will still work
		out. It would just mean that there may be an extra step of reducing the final answer. 
	</p>
	<p>
		There are many ways to find common multiples of numbers. For fractions involving numbers, we can usually use
		intuition and experience to get the correct value. But there are also other methods we can use for larger
		numbers. One of those methods is a "brute force" method where you simply list out multiples of both numbers and
		look for the smallest number to appear in both lists:

						Find the least \\ common multiple of \\ $12$ and $32$.

				\draw[-stealth] (0,0) -- (2,0); 
				\draw (2,0) node[anchor=west] {
					\begin{tabular} {ll}
						Multiples of $12$: \amp $12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, \boxed{96}, 108, \ldots$ \\

		This approach works and helps to reinforce the idea of common multiples, but it's a clumsy approach that doesn't
		generalize to variable expressions. A more robust and intuitive approach builds off of finding the greatest
		common factors.

			To find the least common multiple of 12 and 32, we will start off by factoring out the greatest common

			factor, and so those are the things we need to multiply by to find the least common multiple.

		Finding the least common multiple of two expressions is simply a part of adding and subtracting fractions.
		Once we identify what the least common multiple of the denominators is (the least common denominator), we
		then need to rewrite both fractions with that denominator, and then add the results.
