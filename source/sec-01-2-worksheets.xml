                mathematical manipulation.

					Don't assume that if you end up with a fraction that you must have done something wrong! You will
                    need to develop the self-confidence to assess your work based on the logic and not the answer.

					Problem solving is an important life skill. If you can only work with information when it's
                    presented in one specific way, you don't have a complete understanding of it.

					Students sometimes get confused when division involves the number zero. We'll look into division in
                    detail later. For now, just remember that zero divided by anything is zero and that you should never
                    divide by zero.

					Sometimes, in the process of solving an equation, you may end up with the variable on the right
                    side. It is conventional to have your final answer written with the variable on the left side, even
                    if both <m>7 = y</m> and <m>y = 7</m> mean the same thing. It's not a big deal if you don't do this,
                    but it's a nice thing to do.

					It is usually much easier for us to see errors in other people's work than it is to see them in our
                    own. One way to help find your own errors is to walk away for a while and come back later. This
                    gives your brain a chance to "forget" what you did so that you can rethink everything from the
                    beginning. Wait... did you think this is a discussion about algebra?

					This is known as "completing the square." You may not know what it is or why you're doing it right
                    now, but this is an important algebraic concept that will likely see later. For now, just focus on
                    practicing your algebra.
