    <title>Deliberate Practice: Solving Equations for a Variable Expression</title>
    <p>
        Algebra is a skill, which means it requires practice to become proficient. But it will take more than rote
        repetition to get there. Deliberate practice is the thoughtful repetition of a task. For each of these sections,
        you will be given a list of specific skills or ideas to focus on as you practice thinking through the problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Focus on these skills:</em>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Write the original equation.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Line up your equal signs.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Correctly state the algebraic steps using the correct phrasing:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Add (expression) to both sides.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Subtract (expression) from both sides.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Multiply both sides by (expression).
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Divide both sides by (expression).
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Execute the algebra and arithmetic correctly.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Present your work legibly.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
