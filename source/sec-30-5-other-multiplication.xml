	<title>Going Deeper: Alternative Multiplication Techniques</title>
	<p>
		On Worksheet 5, we looked at how the standard multiplication algorithm (multiplication in columns) has all of
		the same components as looking at multiplication using the grid method we used for algebra. This grid method
		also has a connection to the base-10 diagrams that were used on Worksheet 4. We're going to look at a couple
		other multiplication methods. The first is another representations of the same idea, and the second one is a
		surprising method discovered by the ancient Egyptians that uses only multiplication by with addition.

		<title>The Lattice Method</title>
		<p>
			The lattice method is an organizational scheme for calculating products. This method is convenient because
			it tracks the place values for you, so that you don't need to keep track of the trailing zeros in your
			numbers. Interestingly, this method of calculation was independently discovered by Arab, European, and
			Chinese mathematicians. 
		</p>
		<p>
			To use the lattice method, you start by creating a grid where the number of columns is the number of digits
			in the first number of the product, and the number of rows is the number of digits in the second column.
			Then write the digits of the numbers in the correspond positions. Lastly, draw the up-right diagonals
			through all of the boxes. Here is an example:

			</latex-image>
		</image>
		<p>
			From here, you write out the products of each pair of numbers in the corresponding square, where the tens
			digit goes in the upper-left region and the ones digit goes on the lower-right. If your product gives a
			one-digit number, use a in the tens digit.

			Next, you add along the diagonals down and to the left. Start from the lower-right and work your way to the
			upper-right. If you end up with a number larger than carry the tens digit to the next diagonal. The final
			answer is the collection of digits read from the top-left down, then to the right.

			Although the presentation of this calculation feels significantly different, it's actually the exact same
			concept that we used with the grid. To see the connection, we simply need to rearrange how we calculate the
			products. The primary distinction between these two methods is that the place values are being tracked by
			the diagonals in the lattice method, whereas the grid method requires you to keep track of that yourself.
			This makes the final addition step significantly more compact.

			Ultimately, neither method is necessarily better than the other. They both accomplish the same thing, and
			there are costs and benefits to each. The lattice method is similar to the traditional multiplication
			algorithm in that there are some ideas that get lost in the process. If you were just following the "rules"
			of the calculation, you may not necessarily see the connection between the diagonals and the place values
			On the other hand, it's hard for the grid method to compete with the organization provided by the lattice
			method.

		<title>The Egyptian Multiplication Method</title>
		
		<aside>
			<p>
				It's interesting just how often mathematical ideas are discovered (or created) by multiple people at
				different times and different places. 
			</p>
		</aside>
		<p>
			The Egyptian multiplication method is named this way because they were the first known culture to have
			adopted this method. There is a similar method called the Russian peasant multiplication method, which was a
			rediscovery of the method by Russian peasants in the 19th century. This method is significantly different
			from our other methods because the only multiplication is multiplication by 2. The simplicity of the
			calculations is part of the appeal of the method. 
		</p>
		<p>
			We will perform the same calculation as before: <m>126 \times 23</m>. We start by making two columns. The
			first column starts with the number 1 and the second column starts with the larger number in our product.
		</p>
		<image xml:id="sec-mult-5-egyptian-1" width="15%">
			<latex-image>
				\begin{tikzpicture}
					\draw(0,0) node[anchor=south] {
						\begin{tabular}{c|c}
							1 \amp 126 \\ \\ \\ \\
						\end{tabular}
					};
				\end{tikzpicture}
			</latex-image>
		</image>
		<p>
			From here, we're going to double each entry moving down the column, stopping when the first column will
			exceed the second number in the product.
		</p>
		<aside>
			<p>
				If we double 16 we get 32 and that is larger than 23.
			</p>
		</aside>
		<image xml:id="sec-mult-5-egyptian-2" width="15%">
			<latex-image>
				\begin{tikzpicture}
					\draw(0,0) node[anchor=south] {
						\begin{tabular}{c|c}
							1 \amp 126 \\

							8 \amp 1008 \\
							16 \amp 2016
						\end{tabular}
					};
				\end{tikzpicture}
			</latex-image>
		</image>
		<p>
			Next, we look for a combination of numbers in the first column that add up to the second number in the
			product. The method is quite simple, but explaining it can be a little wordy. The basic idea is that you
			work your way back up the table, keeping a running total as you go. If keeping the value puts you above your
			target, skip it. Otherwise, you keep it. At some point, you will hit your target number, and you can skip
			any remaining values. The process for this example is performed in steps below.

			For most people, it's quite surprising that this works. Let's take a look at what's actually happening. In
			our example, notice that the right side is always 126 times the left side. For example, the row with on the
			left side has <m>8 \times 126 = 1008</m> on the right. We then picked the rows on the left that add up to 23
			giving us <m>23 = 16 + 4 + 2 + 1</m>. We can take this and multiply both sides by 126:
			<me>
				\begin{aligned}
					23 \times 126 \amp = (16 + 4 + 2 + 1) \times 126 \\
					\amp = (16 \times 126) + (4 \times 126) + (2 \times 126) + (1 \times 126) \\
					\amp = 2016 + 504 + 252 + 126 
				\end{aligned}
			</me>
			We can see that the third line consists of the same values that appeared in the right-most column. 
		</p>
		<p>
			From a mathematical perspective, there's not much difference between the groupings that are being used in
			this method and the base-10 groupings. All we've done is broken up the product into smaller pieces. In fact,
			we could even go as far as saying that the only difference between this method and the multiplications we've
			done previously is that this method is using a binary (or base-2) approach. So even though it looks very
			different, the underlying concepts are actually still the same. 
		</p>
		<aside>
			<p>
				Another method is known as Vedic multiplication, which is similar to the standard algorithm but with a
				fancier organizational scheme. 
			</p>
		</aside>
		<p>
			The point of showing you these examples is to further expand your perspective of multiplication. What is
			normally taught as a very rigid process turns out to have many different approaches.
