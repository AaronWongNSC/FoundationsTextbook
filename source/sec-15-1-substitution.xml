		In the previous sections, we were looking at lines in isolation of each other. In this section, we're going to
		look at the ways that two lines can interact with each other. 
	</p>
	<p>
		A solution to a linear equation is a pair of values <m>(x, y)</m> that make the equation true. When we talk
		about a simultaneous system of linear equations, we are looking for a pair of values <m>(x, y)</m> that satisfy
		all of the equations at the same time. This is probably best understood graphically. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The solution of a single linear equation can be represented as a line. Every point on this line can be plugged
		into that equation and yield a true result. If we add in a second linear equation, we get a different line.
		These are represented as the two separate graphs below.

			We are going to focus on systems of two linear equations with two variables. Consider the following system:

			As noted in the definition, a solution must solve all the equations. This means that even though
			<m>(1, 1)</m> is a solution of <m>x + y = 2</m> and <m>(2, -2)</m> is a solution of <m>x - y = 4</m>,
			neither nor would be a solution to the system because when we plug in the values, we don't solve both.

		This is an example of solving an equation by substitution. The idea of a substitution here is the same as we
		used earlier, where we simply replace a symbol in an equation with some other collection of symbols, which then
		reduces the equation to a single variable equation that we can solve.

			In general, the equations will not be given to you in slope-intercept form. This means that you will have to
			choose which variable to solve for and from which equation. There are no rules for this. You can sometimes

		If the system of equations involves two lines with the same slope, but the equations are not written in
		slope-intercept form, you may not immediately recognize that they have the same slope. However, in the process
		of working through the algebra, you will end up with all of the variable terms canceling out. If that happens,
		the equation that you're left with will tell you whether the lines overlap or not. If you get a valid
		mathematical equation, such as <m>0 = 0</m>, then the two lines overlap. If you end up with an invalid
		mathematical equation, such as <m>2 = 5</m>, then the lines do not overlap.

			For multiplication of fractions, you need to multiply straight across. If you are multiplying by an integer,

			fine. If you don't, you can just reduce after multiplying. The problems in this section will not involve
			large enough numbers for that to be important. Make sure to reduce your fractions when you finish.
