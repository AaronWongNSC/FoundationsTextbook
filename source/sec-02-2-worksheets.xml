		<exercise>
			<p>
				Determine the value of <m>3x - 5</m> when <m>x = 4</m>, <m>x = 9</m>, and <m>x = -5</m>. Write your
				results as if-then statements.

				Solve <m>y + c = 7</m> for <m>y</m> using a complete presentation.

		<exercise>
			<p>
				Solve <m>x^2 + c = 7</m> for <m>x^2</m> using a complete presentation. 
			</p>
			<aside>
				<p>
					How did you solve <m>y + c = 7</m> for the variable <m>y</m>? Do the same thing here.

				Solve the equation <m>ax + b = c</m> for the variable <m>x</m> using a complete presentation. 
			</p>
			<aside>
				<p>
					One of the biggest hurdles for students in math is a lack of self confidence to the point that they
					shut down without even trying. Trust yourself that you have the knowledge and experience to solve
					this one, and just give it a try.

		<title>Worksheet 2</title>
		<exercise>
			<p>
				Determine the value of <m>2x - 5y</m> when <m>x = 4</m> and <m>y = 2</m>, and when <m>x = 2</m>, and
				<m>y = -3</m>. Write your results as if-then statements. 
			</p>
			<aside>
				<p>
					There is no example in the book for how to deal with two variable substitutions at the same time,
					but you can figure it out.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the "then" part of your sentence, you only need to say <m>2x - 5y = \text{(number)}</m>. We'll
					discuss the presentation of this later. 
				</p>
			</aside>
		</exercise>
		<exercise>
			<p>
				Check the presentation for errors. If you find one, circle it and describe the mistake in words. 
			</p>
			<aside>
				<p>
					Hint: In this problem, there's nothing wrong with the fraction manipulations. You can use that part
					of the calculation as a model for future problems.

					\begin{aligned}
						2x + 4y \amp = 10 \\
						4y \amp = 2x + 10 \amp \amp \text{Add $2x$ to both sides} \\
						y \amp = \frac{2x + 10}{4} \amp \amp \text{Divide both sides by $4$} \\
						y \amp = \frac{2x}{4} + \frac{10}{4} \amp \amp \text{Rewrite the fraction} \\
						y \amp = \frac{x}{2} + \frac{5}{2} \amp \amp \text{Reduce} 
					\end{aligned}

			</p>
			<aside>
				<p>
					Eventually, the dividing and rewriting should be something you can do mentally in one step. Whether
					you rewrite the one fraction as two separate fractions will depend on the context.

			<p>
				Solve the equation <m>2x + 3y = 6</m> for the variable <m>y</m> using a complete presentation. 
			</p>
			<aside>
				<p>
					This is a common type of calculation when working with equations of lines. We'll see more of this
					later.

			<p>
				Solve the equation <m>2x + 3y = 6</m> for the variable <m>x</m> using a complete presentation.

					This looks a lot like the previous problem. Pay attention to the details of the wording in the
					instructions.

				Solve <m>4x - 3y = 6</m> for <m>y</m> using a complete presentation.
