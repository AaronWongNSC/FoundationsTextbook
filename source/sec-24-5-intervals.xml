		In this section, we introduced a couple geometric representation of the numbers. We are going to focus our
		attention on the number line picture in the context of thinking about inequalities. Suppose that we have the
		inequality <m>x \gt a</m>. Here's how we would represent that on the number line:

		The arrows on the end of the thickened lines indicates that it extends forever in the indicated direction. This
		introduces the concept of infinity, which is denoted <m>\infty</m>. We are going to have to leave this at an
		intuitive level, as infinity turns out to be an incredibly complicated and nuanced topic. The key fact is that
		infinity is <em>not</em> a number. It is not a part of the number line. For our purposes, it represents the idea
		of continuing along in the same direction indefinitely. We also have an infinity in both directions, where 
		<m>\infty</m> (sometimes written <m>+\infty</m> for emphasis) is off to the right and <m>-\infty</m> is off to
		the left. The diagram below is an attempt to convey this idea:

			There are two types of compound inequalities. We can combine them with the word <term>and</term> to indicate
			that we want both conditions to be met, or we can combine them with the word <term>or</term> to indicate that

		There are times that we want to restrict our values on two sides. For example, if you want a number between 1
		and 5 (not restricting yourself to integers), you're actually asking for the number to meet two conditions at
		the same time: (1) The number must be greater than 1; (2) The number must be less than 5. This is an example of
		a compound inequality.

		Graphically, this is not too hard to think about, as the betweenness property is captured intuitively. Notice
		that we wrote this as a single inequality. Even though this looks like just one inequality, it's actually
		shorthand for two inequalities: <m>1 \lt x</m> and <m>x \lt 5</m>. 
	</p>
	<p>
		It's important that the direction of the inequality is consistent. If the inequalities get turned around, we
		treat it as a meaningless statement. For example, <m>1 \lt x \gt 8</m> is <em>not</em> interpreted as
		<m>1 \lt x</m> and <m>x \gt 8</m>. If we look at what that would mean, we can see that there's a bit of
		redundancy in that interpretation. We would be looking for values to the right of 1 that are also to the right
		of 8. But every number to the right of 8 is already to the right of 1, so the first part doesn't really add
		anything but confusion. So it leads to cleaner communication to declare that such combinations are not allowed.

		Sets of these types are known as <term>intervals</term>. They play an important role in understanding and
		describing functions and other mathematical objects. We have seen that we can describe intervals using diagrams
		and inequalities, and it turns out that there is one more method that we use, which is known as <term>interval
		notation</term>. The value of interval notation is that it allows us to describe an interval using symbols, but
		without introducing a variable. When talking about a number between and it's not necessarily helpful for us to
		arbitrarily pick a symbol to represent that quantity. This is especially true for more complicated situations
		where we're already working with several other variables.

		Interval notation is easiest to understand through to the number line diagrams that we've been drawing. There
		are just a couple ideas that we need. The first idea is that we always want to think about the diagram from left
		to right. And this is easy to remember because your notation will be written out from left to right. The second
		is that we use a round bracket to exclude the endpoint and a square bracket to include it. Here is the example
		we were working with before.

		With these examples in mind, you should be able to represent any interval using three different representations:
		a number line diagram, an inequality (or compound inequality), and interval notation. You should also be able to
		move freely between the different forms. For example, if you're given a number line diagram, you should be able
		to translate that into an inequality as well as writing it in interval notation.

		Interval notation is used very often as part of the larger language of mathematics. While the notation is easy
		to understand on its own, it can be difficult to understand how we use it in applications without placing it in
		a larger context. Those larger contexts require some ideas that go beyond what we've developed. We will use one
		example that involves describing the behavior of a function. It will hopefully be intuitive, but don't worry too
		much if it's not. Consider the following graph:
