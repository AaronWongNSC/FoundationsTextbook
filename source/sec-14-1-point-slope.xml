		The slope-intercept form of a line is useful when using them in practical applications. However, when it comes
		to writing down the equation of a line, it is often inconvenient. The challenge is that for the slope-intercept
		form, the location of the initial point is restricted to being the and that's not always true of the available
		information. 
	</p>
	<p>
		We are going to consider the situation where we know one point on the line and we know what the slope of the
		line is. The known point will be labeled as <m>(x_0, y_0)</m>. We are also going to pick another point on the
		line and call it <m>(x,y)</m>. The goal is to find a mathematical relationship between these two points.

		The only piece of information that has not been used is the slope. The slope is the same value no matter which
		two points on the line are chosen, so we will use these two points. The rise is the change in the
		<m>y</m>-coordinates and the run is	the change in the <m>x</m>-coordinates. We calculate these by taking the
		differences between the corresponding coordinates.

		<title>Lines Have Multiple Representations in Point-Slope Form</title>
		<p>
			It turns out that a line has multiple representations using the point-slope form, depending on which point
			is considered to be the initial point. This is much easier to identify from a graph. Notice that the lines

		<title>Rewriting Point-Slope Form in Slope-Intercept Form</title>
		<p>
			Because there are multiple representations of a single line, we say that the point-slope form of a line is
			<em>not unique</em>. This means that two different people may end up getting different answers to the same
			question, and they can both be correct. One way to check that the equations represent the same line is to
