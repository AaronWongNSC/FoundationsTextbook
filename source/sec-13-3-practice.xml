	<title>Deliberate Practice: Slope-Intercept Form</title>
    <p>
        Algebra is a skill, which means it requires practice to become proficient. But it will take more than rote
        repetition to get there. Deliberate practice is the thoughtful repetition of a task. For each of these sections,
        you will be given a list of specific skills or ideas to focus on as you practice thinking through the problems.
