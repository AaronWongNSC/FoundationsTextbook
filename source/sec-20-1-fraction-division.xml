		Consider the following story:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		Suppose there are ten pieces of candy in the candy jar. You and a friend decide that you'll each take one half
		of the candy. So you divide the candy into two equal portions, and you each enjoyed your share of five pieces
		of candy.
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		It not a particularly interesting story from the storytelling perspective. But something very interesting
		happened from a mathematical point of view. Let's take a closer look. 
	</p>
	<p>
		In one way of looking at the story, we're talking about a multiplication problem. Both you and your friend each
		get half of a group of 10.

		What this is showing us is that there is a relationship between multiplication and division. Multiplying by
		<m>\frac{1}{2}</m> is the same as dividing by 2. And while this is a simple example, it does help us to clearly
		see that there is a relationship. We can even write 2 as <m>\frac{2}{1}</m> (since <m>2 \div 1 = 2</m>) and use
		this to declare that dividing is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal of a number.
	</p>
	<aside>
		<p>
			The formal definition of the reciprocal is below. 
		</p>
	</aside>
	<p>
		But this doesn't actually explain anything. It just observes a computation and then declares it to be a rule
		without explaining bringing any insight as to why. This is another example of the difference between driving a
		car and understanding how it works. 
	</p>
	<aside>
		<p>
			"I step on the pedal and it goes" is not an explanation of how a car works.

		There are many levels of understanding fraction division. We're going to focus on the algebraic understanding
		here, and give you a chance to explore some of the more visual interpretations in the worksheets. Let's take a
		look at a general division of fractions calculation: <m>\frac{a}{b} \div \frac{c}{d}</m>. Since fractions are a
		representation of division, we could rewrite this as a fraction where the numerator and denominator are
		themselves fractions:
		<me>
			\frac{a}{b} \div \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ \frac{a}{b} }{ \frac{c}{d} }
		</me>
	</p>
	<aside>
		<p>
			We did this when found common denominators for adding and subtracting fractions. 
		</p>
	</aside>
	<p>
		At first, the may appear to be a worse situation, since the notation seems to be a mess of symbols. But when we
		write it this way, we can use what we know about rewriting fractions, which is that as long as we multiply or
		divide the top and bottom of a fraction by the same quantity, we do not change its value. With a little bit of
		insight, we can come to the conclusion that our goal is to make it so that the numerator and denominator of the
		overall fraction are just integers.
		<me>
			\frac{a}{b} \div \frac{c}{d}
				= \frac{ \frac{a}{b} }{ \frac{c}{d} }
				= \frac{ \frac{a}{b} \cdot bd }{ \frac{c}{d} \cdot bd }
				= \frac{ad}{bc} = \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{d}{c}
		</me> 
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice that we have rewritten the division calculation as a multiplication calculation, and that the second
		fraction got flipped over. This is why some students learn fraction division as "keep-change-flip." But this
		pushes the calculation even deeper into the realm of simply following rules. So we will talk about this at a
		higher mathematical level by using proper terminology.

        <statement>
            <p>
				The <term>reciprocal</term> of the fraction <m>\frac{a}{b}</m> is <m>\frac{b}{a}</m> as long as

		From this definition, we can say that dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal. And
		we can see that this is derived from writing division as a fraction and simplifying the fraction.

				In fact, you can also turn problems written with the <m>\div</m> symbol as a fraction of fractions then
				use either of these techniques. 
			</p>

		<p>
			Sometimes, the problem will be given to you as fractions inside of fractions. At that point, you can go
			either multiply by the reciprocal or simplify the fraction by multiplying the top and the bottom by the
			same quantity. 
		</p>
		<p>
			This is what multiplication by the reciprocal looks like: 
			<me>
				\begin{aligned}
					\frac{ \frac{6}{25} }{ \frac{7}{3} }
						\amp = \frac{6}{25} \cdot \frac{3}{7}
							\amp \eqnspacer \amp \text{Multiply by the reciprocal} \\
						\amp = \frac{18}{175} 
				\end{aligned}

		</p>
		<aside>
			<p>
				This is the same step as multiplying the top and bottom by the same number when adding or subtracting fractions. 
			</p>
		</aside>
		<p>
			And this is what simplifying within the fraction looks like: 
			<me>
				\begin{aligned}
					\frac{ \frac{6}{25} }{ \frac{7}{3} }
						\amp = \frac{ \frac{6}{\cancel{25}} \cdot \cancel{25} \cdot 3}{ \frac{7}{\cancel{3}} \cdot 25 \cdot \cancel{3}}
							\amp \eqnspacer \amp \text{Simplify the fraction} \\
					\amp = \frac{18}{175} 
				\end{aligned}
			</me>
		</p>
		<p>
			It is helpful to be familiar with both of these. As fractions become more complicated, there are times that
			multiplying by the reciprocal is the more difficult approach. Ultimately, those are decisions you will learn
			to make based on your experience and the specific expression you're working with.
