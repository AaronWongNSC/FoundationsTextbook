	<title>Going Deeper: Three Dimensional Systems</title>
	<p>
		In the last couple sections, we've looked at systems of two linear equations with two variables. We saw that
		there was a geometric aspect to understanding these systems by looking at the graphs of the lines, and we also
		saw that there was an algebraic aspect by looking at the methods of solving these systems. We are going to take
		a look at what happens when we increase the complexity by looking at systems of three equations and three
		variables. Here is an example: 
		<me>
			\left\{ \begin{array}{rcrcrcr}
				2x \amp - \amp y \amp - \amp z \amp = \amp 1 \\
				x \amp + \amp 2y \amp + \amp z \amp = \amp 4 \\
				x \amp + \amp y \amp - \amp z \amp = \amp 4
			\end{array} \right.
		</me> 
	</p>
	<p>
		We will first wrap our minds around the geometric understanding of these equations. It turns out that these
		formulas form planes and that planes are the natural shape to generalize the "linear-ness" of lines in two
		variables. When we think about three simultaneous systems of equations in three variables, we're looking for a
		point that lies on all three planes. Since the number of dimensions has increased, it makes sense that the
		number of possible arrangements would also increase. However, we still have the three same basic classifications
		that we had before. There will either be zero solutions, one solution, or infinitely many solutions.

		In each of the systems above, there are no solutions. This may seem unusual at first, since there are clearly
		some points of intersection. However, we are working with <em>simultaneous</em> systems of equations, which
		means that we're looking for points that lie on <em>all three</em> planes, not just pairs of planes. Notice that
		we cannot use the simple heuristic of just thinking about whether the planes are parallel, because the diagram
		on the right shows that it's possible to have no solutions even though none of the planes are parallel to each
		other. 
	</p>
	<p>
		A key observation about these diagrams is that when there are intersections between planes, it forms a line.
		This is always true of the intersection of two planes, which is an idea we'll come back to when we look at the
		algebra.

		This is an example of a system with one solution. Although everything is drawn to be at right angles with each
		other, there is a lot of flexibility in terms of the relative positions of the planes. You should be able to
		visualize each pair of planes forming a line, and that each of those lines cross each other in exactly one
		place.

			The diagram stacks are meant to indicate that the planes overlap each other. It's hard to visually represent
			that without having at least some separation between them.

		Lastly, we have these configurations to get infinitely many points of intersection. The diagram on the left has
		all three planes overlapping each other. The middle diagram has two planes overlapping each other with the third
		plane cutting across them. The last diagram has all three planes intersecting along the same line. Even though
		these all have infinitely many solutions, there is a distinction between the first one and the last two.
		Intuitively, what we're seeing are different numbers of dimensions in the overlap. The intersection of the
		first diagram is a two-dimensional plane, whereas the intersection of the last two are a one-dimensional line. 
	</p>
	<aside>
		<p>
			This suggests that we might call the single point of intersection a zero-dimensional object.

	<p>
		When it comes to solving these systems algebraically, it's just the methodical application of either
		substitution or elimination to reduce the number of variables. Conceptually, we're going to find the
		intersection of planes to get lines, then find the intersection of lines to get points. When working through the
		process, it's much more about keeping the work organized so that you don't get lost.

				Just as with the systems with two equations, there are many paths to the solution. You are encouraged to try other paths for practice.

			We will solve the first equation for <m>z</m>:
			<me>
				\begin{aligned}
					2x - y - z \amp = 1 \\
					z \amp = 2x - y - 1
				\end{aligned}

				\begin{aligned}
					x + 2y + z \amp = 4 \\

			We can now solve for <m>y</m> in the first of the new equations: 
			<me>
				\begin{aligned}
					3x + y \amp = 5 \\
					y \amp = -3x + 5

			And plug that into the second of the new equations and solve for <m>x</m>:
			<me>
				\begin{aligned}

					-x + 2(-3x + 5) \amp = 3 \\
					-7x + 10 \amp = 3 \\
					x \amp = 1

			We can now work backwards to get the remaining variables.
			<me>
				\begin{aligned}
					y \amp = -3x + 5 \\
					\amp = -3(1) + 5 \\
					\amp = 2
