			<p>
				Calculate <m>t^2 \cdot t^4</m> using a presentation that shows all of the individual steps. Then verify
				that the product rule gives the same result. 
			</p>
			<aside>
				<p>
					Why write it out when there's a formula? It's important to really understand the formula and not
					just use it. Otherwise, you might apply the wrong formula at the wrong time and not understand why
					things are off.

		<title>Worksheet 2</title>
		<exercise>
			<p>

		<exercise>
			<p>
				Calculate <m>\left( x^{-1} \right)^{-n}</m> using the power rule. Then rewrite the part of the
				expression inside the parentheses using the definition of negative exponents. In order for the math to
				be consistent, the two results should be equal. Explain how this verifies the first formula in
				<xref ref="thm-more-properties-of-exponents" />. 
			</p>
			<aside>
				<p>
					Mathematicians like their formulas to be as consistent as possible.

		<exercise>
			<p>
				Start from the equation <m>x^{-n} = \frac{1}{x^n}</m> and take the reciprocal of both sides of the
				equation. Explain how this verifies the second formula in <xref ref="thm-more-properties-of-exponents" />. 
			</p>
			<aside>
				<p>
					Recall that the reciprocal of the fraction <m>\frac{a}{b}</m> is <m>\frac{b}{a}</m>.

					Remember that variables are just numbers in disguise. What would you do for this problem if the
					exponents were just numbers?

			<p>
				Consider the following presentation: 
				<me>
					\begin{aligned}
						x^3 \cdot x^{-3} \amp = x^3 \cdot \frac{1}{x^3} \amp \eqnspacer \amp \text{Definition of negative exponents} \\
						\amp = \frac{x^3}{x^3} \amp \amp \text{Multiply fractions} \\
						\amp = \frac{x \cdot x \cdot x}{x \cdot x \cdot x} \amp \amp \text{Definition of exponents} \\
						\amp = \frac{\cancel{x \cdot x \cdot x}}{\cancel{x \cdot x \cdot x}} \amp \amp \text{Reduce the fraction} \\
						\amp = 0 
					\end{aligned}
