				There is a common phrase that is associated with subtraction: "Subtraction is addition of the opposite."
				Integer chips and the number line can help to illuminate this concept. Consider the following diagram:

							\draw (0,-1.5) node[anchor=north] {\strut $1$}; 
						\end{scope}
						\draw (5,-1.5) node[anchor=north] {\strut $+$};

					What does it mean for one thing to be the "opposite" of another thing? 
				</p>
			</aside>
			<p>
				 How would you describe the idea that and are "opposite" numbers? How well does this idea extend to
				 other numbers? 
			</p>
		</exercise>
		<exercise>
			<p>
				Describe how integer chips can be used to demonstrate the idea that "subtraction is addition of the
				opposite." (Hint: You may want to think about the physical manipulation of the chips when doing
				subtraction, and the relationship between a number and its opposite.) 
			</p>
		</exercise>
		<exercise>
			<p>
				The more technical term of the "opposite" of a number is the "additive inverse" of a number. The
				additive inverse of a number is the number that has the property that <m>a + b = 0</m>. Using this
				definition, we can see that is the opposite of since <m>1 + (-1) = 0</m>. Use this definition to argue
				that the additive inverse of the additive inverse of a number is itself. 
			</p>
			<aside>
				<p>
					This is another tricky problem. Focus on the defining property of the additive inverse of a number.
