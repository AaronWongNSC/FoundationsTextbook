				Here is a trick for mental arithmetic when one of the numbers is close to a multiple of 10 or 100.
				Figure out how far you are from that "nice" number and move that many steps first. Then the remaining
				movement is much easier to do. Here's a visualization of <m>97 + 58</m>:

		<exercise>
			<p>
				We are going to spend this time looking at numbers from the Greek perspective. This means that we're
				going to think of numbers as being sticks of specific lengths. With this in mind, addition of numbers
				is represented by finding the total length of two sticks put end-to-end.
			</p>
			<aside>
				<p>
					The units can be whatever you want them to be: inches, feet, centimeters, miles, ...
				</p>
			</aside>
			<p>
				One of the reasons that the Greeks liked this framework is because it allows us to work with abstract
				ideas about arithmetic rather than actually having to measure out physical lengths. We can simply
				replace the numbers with variables and the picture remains meaningful.
