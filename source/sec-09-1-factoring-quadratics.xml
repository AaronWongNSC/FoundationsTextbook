		Factoring quadratic polynomials is generally seen as an important marker for a student's algebra skill level.
		Because of this, various teachers have tried to design particular methods to help students factor correctly.
		Unfortunately, many of those methods are answer-oriented, which leads to students getting into the habit of
		making incorrect algebraic manipulations. 
	</p>
	<p>
		In this section, the focus is going to be on understanding the process of factoring and the ideas behind it.
		Although getting the right answer is also important, the right answer is the outcome of a proper understanding
		of the concepts, not the ultimate end in itself. 
	</p>
	<aside>
		<p>
			If you want physical manipulatives, you can purchase algebra tiles or make them out of paper. 
		</p>
	</aside>
	<p>
		To emphasize this point, we're going to use a purely geometric framework and sidestep all of the algebra. A
		couple sections ago, we introduced algebra tiles. These are geometric images that represent different quantities
		to help us think about algebraic relationships. 
	</p>
	<aside>
		<p>
			The basic idea is that you have positive and negative versions of the tiles, and one positive and one
			negative of the same type of tile will cancel each other out. 
		</p>
	</aside>
	<p>
		Algebra tiles come with a set of "rules" for how they can be manipulated, which is especially important when
		you're working with negative values. However, for the purposes of illustration, we're just going to focus on
		the situation where all of the values are positive. This means that we're going to be thinking about three
		different tiles (both tiles should be viewed as the same piece, just rotated relative to each other):

		While the use of diagrams (or physical manipulatives) may help us to get answers, it doesn't necessarily help us
		to think in an organized and logical manner. So we are going to look at a structured algebraic approach to the
		same challenge. 
	</p>
	<p>
		But before we do that, let's take a look at why factoring is difficult. Let's take a look at the steps of
		expanding out a product. 
		<me>
			\begin{aligned}
				2x^2 + 7x + 6 \amp = 2x^2 + x + 6x + 6 \\
				\amp = 2x^2 + 2x + 5x + 6 \\
				\amp = 2x^2 + 3x + 4x + 6 
			\end{aligned}
		</me>
	</p>
	<aside>
		<p>
			We're not going to draw out the grid for these products. But if you want to, you can. 
		</p>
	</aside>
	<p>
		At this point, you can still factor by grouping to get back the original product. 
		<me>
			\begin{aligned}
				2x^2 + 7x + 6 \amp = 2x^2 + x + 6x + 6 \\
				\amp = 2x^2 + 2x + 5x + 6 \\
				\amp = 2x^2 + 3x + 4x + 6 
			\end{aligned}
		</me>
	</p>
	<p>
		The challenge arises once the like terms are combined. We no longer have access to the rationale behind
		uncombining the like terms. In fact, there are lots of ways to uncombine like terms! 
		<me>
			\begin{aligned}
				2x^2 + 7x + 6 \amp = 2x^2 + x + 6x + 6 \\
				\amp = 2x^2 + 2x + 5x + 6 \\
				\amp = 2x^2 + 3x + 4x + 6 
			\end{aligned}

			These examples don't even take into account possibilities with negative numbers!

	<p>
		Some students learn how to do this with monic polynomials with a guessing method, but it very often falls apart
		on them when they are working on non-monic polynomials. At the core, most of the problems arise from the
		students learning to simply "write down" their answer without understanding how or why it worked. We want to
		avoid that type of method because it does not enhance mathematical thinking. 
	</p>
	<aside>
		<p>
			There are some methods that lead students to write down expressions that are mathematical nonsense, and then
			do some manipulations from there to get the answer. 
		</p>
	</aside>
	<p>
		We will be using the "<m>ac</m> method" of factoring. The goal is to uncover the right way to uncombine like
		terms so that we can factor by grouping. Here is a representation of the method:
		<me>
			ax^2 + bx + c \longrightarrow \left\{
				\begin{array}{l}
					\text{Multiply to $ac$} \\
					\text{Add to $b$}
				\end{array}
				\right.
		</me>
	</p>
	<aside>
		<p>
			Here are a few of the reasons for this choice: 
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>All the steps are algebraically valid.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The same technique is used for both monic and non-monic quadratics.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>It builds on the same intution as most of the other methods.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
	</aside>
	<p>
		As the text states, the goal is to find two numbers that multiply to and add to The values you obtain from this
		will be the way to uncombine the like terms, which will allow you to factor by grouping.

			What two numbers multiply to -10 and add to -3? You should be able to determine that the values are -2 and
			5. These two values are used to uncombine the like terms (<m>-3x = -5x + 2x</m>), which then allows us to

		One of the main values of the method is that it works for both monic and non-monic polynomials. This benefit
		allows us to simplify the process of factoring quadratic polynomials to a single approach that works for all
		situations. So by adopting the method, we don't have to create two different sets of methods to accomplish the
		same goal.
