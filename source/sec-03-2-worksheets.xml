					Mistakes involving negative signs and subtraction symbols are among the most common mistakes for
					students to make. Part of the value of this exercise is to train your mind to pay close attention to
					those symbols.

				Simplify the expression <m>(5a + 3b) + (8a - 5b)</m> using a complete presentation. Show the
				rearrangement step, the grouping step, and the arithmetic step. 
			</p>
			<aside>
				<p>
					We are asking you to show all of the steps because it's important to be able to communicate these
					manipulations clearly. Use these instructions like a checklist of algebraic manipulations that you
					should know how to do.

			<p>
				Two students perform the calculation <m>6x - 6x</m>. One student claims that the answer is <m>x</m>
				while the other claims the answer is 0. Determine which student did the calculation correctly and
				explain your reasoning using complete sentences. Then explain the error that the other student made.

					Knowing why certain manipulations are wrong can be as helpful as knowing why certain manipulations
					are right.

					Although it's important to be able to explain every step carefully, in practice we don't always do
					that. Your instructor may or may not have specific instructions for what they are looking for. Just
					remember that the main thing is that your work must be legible and understandable to someone else.
