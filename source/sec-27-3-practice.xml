	<title>Deliberate Practice: Practice with Negatives</title>
    <p>
        Algebra is a skill, which means it requires practice to become proficient. But it will take more than rote
        repetition to get there. Deliberate practice is the thoughtful repetition of a task. For each of these sections,
        you will be given a list of specific skills or ideas to focus on as you practice thinking through the problems.
    </p>
	<p>
		<em>Focus on these skills:</em>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					Do the problem mentally before drawing any part of the number line diagram. 
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					You are free to draw as few or as many steps in your number line calculation as you find necessary. 
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Present your work legibly. 
				</p>
