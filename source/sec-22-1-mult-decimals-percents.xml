		There is a method that most students learn for multiplying decimals. 
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					Step 1: <m>11 \cdot 36 = 376</m>. 
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Step 2: The number has one decimal and the number has two decimals, resulting in three total decimals. 
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Step 3: Write with three decimal places: 
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, to calculate <m>(1.1) \cdot (0.36)</m>: 
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					Step 1: <m>11 \cdot 36 = 376</m>. 
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Step 2: The number has one decimal and the number has two decimals, resulting in three total decimals. 
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Step 3: Write with three decimal places: 
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<aside>
		<p>
			If you compute <m>(0.2) \cdot (0.4)</m>, the result after the first step is and you don't have two digits in
			that number for your two decimals. It turns out you have to have leading zeros: 0.08.
		</p>
	</aside>
	<p>
		The last step is very rule-minded, as it would be wrong to write as even though that technically has three
		decimal places. And students have to learn how to handle the special case when there are more decimal places
		than digits. 
	</p>
	<p>
		But with all of this, we come back to the question that we've hit many times in this book: Why is this the rule?
		Why do decimals have this strange place-counting rule that we have to learn in order to do decimal
		multiplication correctly? It turns out that the answer comes from fraction multiplication.

		<title>Decimal Multiplication as Fractions</title>
		<aside>
			<p>
				Recall that the number of zeros of the power of in the denominator corresponds to the number of decimal
				places. 
			</p>
		</aside>
		<p>
			Let's look at the example calculation again, but this time work through the framework of fractions. We will
			first rewrite the decimals as fractions and then multiply straight across:
			<me>
				(1.1) \cdot (0.36)
					= \frac{11}{10} \cdot \frac{36}{100}
					= \frac{11 \cdot 36}{10 \cdot 100}
					= \frac{396}{1000}
					= 0.396
			</me>
			Notice that we can immediately see that the numerator is the product in Step 1 of the process. Steps 2 and 3
			in the process come from the denominator. It's basically just tracking the power of that comes out in the
			product. And that's all there is to the rule.

			Calculate <m>(2.4) \cdot (0.03)</m> using fraction multiplication. 
		</p>
		<solution>
			<p>
				<me> (2.4) \cdot (0.03) = \frac{24}{10} \cdot \frac{3}{100} = \frac{24 \cdot 3}{10 \cdot 100} = \frac{72}{1000} = 0.072 </me>

		One of the main applications of decimals comes from percents. Most people know the rule that to convert a number
		to a percent, you move the decimal two places to the left. For example, 50% is just 0.50 (which is often written
		as just 0.5) and 237% would be written as 2.37. Again, we want to transition from this simply being a rule of
		percents and turn it into a concept relating decimals and percents.

				We see "cent" to represent in words like century years) and in the fact that there are cents in a dollar. 
			</p>
		</aside>
		<p>
			The word "percent" can be interpreted literally as "per hundred." So when we write we're saying parts per
			hundred. Notice that this reflects the language of parts of a whole, which leads us to think about this as a
			fraction. And once we write this as a fraction, we can see why it's the same as just moving the decimal two
			places to the left.
			<me>
				75\% = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
			</me>
			Also notice that <m>\frac{75}{100}</m> can be reduced to <m>\frac{3}{4}</m>. You may want to revisit
			<xref ref="sec-das-2-worksheets-5" /> for help with some of these fraction to decimal conversions. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In general, you will want to be able to move fluidly between all three of the notations (decimals,
			fractions, and percents).

			When all the numbers are written with just two decimal places, it makes the conversion to percents and
			fractions simple. And while there is nothing different when working with other numbers of decimals, they are

		We have talked about the literal meaning of a percent, but we haven't talked about its practical significance.
		Why do we even care about percents? A percent gives us a way of thinking about values relative to other values.
		For example, $1000 is a lot of money when you're buying a dinner, but it's a small amount of money when you're
		buying a home. So a percent gives us a relative framework to help us understand the size of something. In fact,
		it is precisely the size of the part relative to the whole. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Here are some visual examples of 50%. The total area of the figure doesn't matter. We are just thinking about the
		part of it relative to the whole amount. Percents are a way of doing that in a uniform manner.

	<p>
		When we talk about percentages, we often talk about a percent "of" something else, and the something else
		represents the whole. But sometimes we have to use context and reading comprehension to determine what the part
		is. 
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					10% of students don't understand percents. (The whole is "all students" and the part is "the
					students that don't understand percents.") 
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					70% of the budget went to salaries. (The whole is "the budget" and the part is "salaries.") 
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Save 20% off of the regular price! (The whole is "the regular price" and the part is "the discount.") 
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		Algebraically, we might write the relationship as
		<me>
			(\text{the percent}) = \frac{(\text{the part})}{(\text{the whole})}
		</me>
		which could be written equivalently as
		<me>
			(\text{the part}) = (\text{the percent}) \cdot (\text{the whole}).
		</me>
		This second version can be read as "the part is the percent of the whole." And this phrasing is a helpful
		reminder of the meaning of percents. 
	</p>
	<p>
		A less fortunate phrasing that students learn is "is over of." This language may help students to set up
		calculations when problems are worded in a specific way, but it gives very little insight into the actual
		meaning of percents. In real life, people don't go around asking "What is 20\% of 45?". It usually comes in a
		less structured form like the following: "The bill was \$45. How much should we tip?" Although we can translate
		the second form into the first after we understand percents, that translation step is where the actual
		understanding of percents is found, and the calculation is just the execution of the idea.

		<title>Working with Percents</title>

			The primary exercise for thinking about percents is the practice of identifying the whole, the part, and the
			percent. While this is a useful mental framework, it's also important to recognize that not every single
			problem will fit into this mold, and that more complex problems require more complex problem-solving skills.
			For the most part, we will keep things simple.

				Complete sentences matter here. The words overlap and collide in a way that can make single word answers
				ambiguous. Sentences force you to think it through completely. 
			</p>
		</aside>
		<p>
			The problems you will be given will be short snippets that contain information that can be translated into a
			percent calculation. Your task will be to identify the part, the whole, and the percent using a complete
			sentence. One of these will always be an unknown quantity. Then you will need to solve for that unknown
			quantity and then use that information to address the question. Here is a full example:
