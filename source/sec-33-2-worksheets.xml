		<title>Worksheet 2</title>
		<exercise>
			<p>
				A box of cans of soda contains 12 cans. Write a relationship between the number of boxes and the number
				of cans of soda. 
			</p>

		<exercise>
			<p>
				A store has a sale on boxes of cans of soda. However, the store limit is 8 boxes per customer. If each
				box of soda contains 12 cans, how many cans of soda can be bought by a single customer during this sale? 
			</p>

				Dr. Pepper is a math professor. Every semester, she buys each of her students a can of her favorite
				soda. She has 30 students in her class. If a box of cans of soda contains 12 cans, how many boxes does
				she need for her class? 
			</p>
		</exercise>
		<exercise>
			<p>
				In the previous question, there were two possible answers, depending on how you saw the problem. You
				might have had a fractional box of sodas, or you might have decided a fractional box of soda doesn't
				make sense and rounded up to an integer number of boxes. Is it possible that both answers are correct,
				or is one answer correct and the other incorrect?
