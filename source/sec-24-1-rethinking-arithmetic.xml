		An important aspect of mathematical thinking is the ability to represent ideas in several different ways. Even
		something as simple as a number can have multiple representations, and those different representations have
		different applications. And it may seem simple, but even just representing numbers as a collection of dots or
		squares is a technique used in higher levels of mathematics to help discover patterns and prove mathematical
		relationships. 
	</p>
	<p>
		We've already used two different representations of numbers in this book. The first is the number line, and the
		second is the place value system. We're going to spend some time exploring these ideas a little more closely to
		deepen our mathematical thinking.

			Horizontal lines are convenient because we read left-to-right, which creates a forward/backward intuition
			that helps.
		</p>
	</aside>
	<p>
		The number line is the ordering of numbers in a straight line based on their values. Traditionally, this line is
		drawn horizontally, though there is no reason that this has to be the case. In fact, the coordinate plane is
		actually two number lines drawn together where one of them is drawn vertically. 
	</p>
	<aside>
		<p>
			Does it even make sense to talk about the "middle" of an infinitely long object? Maybe not, but just a basic
			intuition is good enough for this. 
		</p>
	</aside>
	<p>
		We can think of the number of as being at the middle of the number line, with positive numbers to the right
		of it and negative numbers to the left of it.

		We can visualize any part of the real line that we want using any sense of scale that we want. It does
		not always need to include zero. If the actual location is important, then you should try to use an equal
		spacing. But sometimes all we need is a symbolic representation of the locations. Regardless, it is very
		important that we always keep the order the same, especially with negative numbers. For a portion of the
		line that only has negative numbers, remember that going to the left makes the numbers more negative. Here are
		some examples:

		As we move away from the numbers get bigger in size. The phrase "bigger in size" is important, because the words
		"bigger" and "smaller" on their own create confusion with negative numbers. The size of a number is often called
		its absolute value (or magnitude). Intuitively, is a "big" number by size, but it can also represent a large
		deficit instead of a large quantity. To avoid that confusion, we use the phrases "greater than" and "less than"
		when comparing numbers. These words take away the possibility of misinterpreting the comparison of two numbers.

			Don't try to learn these rules. They're not good for you. 
		</p>
	</aside>
	<p>
		Using the number line to visualize the locations of numbers is a natural approach to comparing numbers. Some
		students learn a slightly complex set of rules for comparing numbers: 
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					If both numbers are positive, then the bigger number is greater than the smaller number. 
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					If one number is positive and the other is negative, then the positive number is greater than the
					negative number. 
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					If both numbers are negative, then the bigger number is less than the smaller number. 
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		While this is accurate, it ends up causing confusion because it turns it into a practice of rule-following
		rather than developing an understanding.

		<title>Ordering Numbers</title>

				Ordering numbers is a skill that simply requires some practice. The best intuition comes from starting
				at and thinking about the number of steps in which direction is required to reach a value. For example,
				starting from 0, to get to the number -45 you would have to move to the left, and on the way you'll pass
				-21. And to reach the number 37 you would start from 0 and move to the right, and when you get there,
				you won't have yet passed 68. This could be represented on a number line.

			Once you are comfortable with locating numbers on the number line, then comparisons thinking about "to the
