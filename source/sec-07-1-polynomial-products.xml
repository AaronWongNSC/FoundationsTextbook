		Multiplication can be represented in several different ways. For this section, we're going to focus on the idea
		of multiplication as the area of a rectangle. The area of a rectangle with length and width is given by
		<m>A = \ell w</m>. This can also be seen by drawing out the grid and counting the squares, though it's a waste
		of time to do it in practice. So we will often represent this symbolically by simply using a box to represent
		the idea of the calculation.

			Abstraction is about focusing on the ideas and not the specific instances. It helps us to see patterns
			instead of just numbers. 
		</p>
	</aside>
	<p>
		One of the advantages of reducing the idea to just a representation is that it creates a space for us to work
		with abstract ideas. Once we stop focusing on specific numbers, we can start to use symbols to represent the
		idea of creating a grid. Consider the following examples:

		We may not know the particular values of the variables and but we see that if we knew what those values were,

			Before we can put this to work for polynomials, we first need to focus a bit on multiplying monomials. There

		You are probably familiar with FOIL (First-Outer-Inner-Last) as a way to do this product. One of the downfalls
		to FOIL is that students end up confused when there are more than two terms in the parentheses. Many are so
		trapped by FOIL that they try to force it to happen even in problems that do not call for it. The basic problem
		is that students do not have an organized sense of what FOIL is supposed to accomplish, and so they treat it
		like a rule to be blindly followed.

			In math (and in life) it's often unhealthy to blindly follow when someone tells you to do something.

		However, this grid method extends very naturally regardless of the number of terms in the parentheses. And it's
		completely built around the basic idea of thinking of multiplication as an area. Having the right organizational
		scheme frees you from having to memorize more and more rules.

				There is no example for you to follow this time. You're going to have to trust yourself. And even if
				you're wrong, you can always reach out to your instructor for help. The answer is
				<m>x^4 - 2x^3 - 17x^2 + 26x - 8</m>.
