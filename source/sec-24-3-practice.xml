	<title>Deliberate Practice: Inequalities and the Number Line</title>
    <p>
        Algebra is a skill, which means it requires practice to become proficient. But it will take more than rote
        repetition to get there. Deliberate practice is the thoughtful repetition of a task. For each of these sections,
        you will be given a list of specific skills or ideas to focus on as you practice thinking through the problems.
    </p>
	<p>
		<em>Focus on these skills:</em>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					Try to make the spacing as even as possible for the equal increments. 
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Pick increments that make sense for the problem. Note that the numbers you plot may not always fall precisely on the marked increments. 
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					For each comparison, think through their relative locations ("to the left of `' or "to the right of"). 
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Present your work legibly. 
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
