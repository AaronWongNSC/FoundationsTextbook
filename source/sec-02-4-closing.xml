    <title>Closing Ideas</title>

        Most textbooks will have hundreds of problems for you to work on, especially for a section like this one. And
        there's certainly value to practicing those manipulations over and over again so that you can get a lot of
        experience. However, the approach of this textbook is much more about slowing you down to help you create a
        solid mental framework for understanding mathematical ideas.

        One piece of that framework of mathematical thinking is the ability to take something complicated and break it
        down into simpler pieces. One of the ways that manifests is the transition from working with numbers to working
        with variables. We tried to set you up with this idea in the forward direction by giving you a series of
        equations with numbers before asking you to work with variables:

        \left. \begin{aligned}
        x + 3 \amp = 7 \longrightarrow \text{Subtract $3$ from both sides} \\
        x + 4 \amp = 7 \longrightarrow \text{Subtract $4$ from both sides} \\
        x + 5 \amp = 7 \longrightarrow \text{Subtract $5$ from both sides} \\
        x + 6 \amp = 7 \longrightarrow \text{Subtract $6$ from both sides}
    \end{aligned} \right\} \implies x + b = 7 \longrightarrow \text{Subtract $b$ from both sides}
