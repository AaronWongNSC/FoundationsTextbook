</h4> <aside class="aside aside-like"><div class="para">You probably had a teacher teach you that this is the right way to write math. Unfortunately, they were wrong and you’re going to need to unlearn it.</div></aside> <div class="para">There is a common way of writing equations that some people use which is less than ideal: <div class="image-box" style="width: 16%; margin-left: 42%; margin-right: 42%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/sec-bap-1-ac3-eq1.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>
</div> <aside class="aside aside-like"><div class="para">A good explanation of an idea should not require the reader to have to guess about what happened. This means that the responsibility is on the writer to write clearly.</div></aside> <div class="para">There are a number of problems with this. To start, there’s not really an organized way to read this. The best way to think of it is that it breaks apart into four pieces with three of them overlapping each other. Another problem is that the reader is expected to simply know what’s happening. This is sometimes at the root of students’ complaints about "skipped steps." <div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/sec-bap-1-ac3-eq1-explained.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>
</div> <aside class="aside aside-like"><div class="para">This all makes sense as you’re writing it out, and it’s good to help you put your ideas together and get the overall picture of what’s happening in a problem, but the final result isn’t a carefully organized presentation. In writing courses, the equivalent work would be called a "rough draft."</div></aside> <div class="para"><em class="alert">Try it!</em></div> <div class="para">Write the calculation in <a href="chapter-basic-algebraic-presentation.html#sec-bap-1-ac3-common-problem" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/sec-bap-1-ac3-common-problem.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Activity 1.3: A Common Presentation Problem">Activity 1.3</a> using a complete presentation.</div> <details class="solution solution-like born-hidden-knowl"><summary class="knowl__link"><span class="type">Solution</span><span class="period">.</span></summary><div class="solution solution-like knowl__content"><div class="para logical"><div class="displaymath process-math">
