<div class="para"> We first need to describe this notation. This is the notation that is used for a <dfn class="terminology">piecewise defined function</dfn>, which is a function that uses different formulas depending on the value that it has been given. You can see that this definition is broken into two parts. The first formula is applied when <span class="process-math">\(x \geq 0\)</span> and the second formula is applied when <span class="process-math">\(x \lt 0\text{.}\)</span> This means that you have to decide which category your number is in before you apply the formulas. If you take a precalculus course, you will probably run into this idea there and get a lot more experience. For now, it is enough to understand that this is a special way of building a function using multiple different pieces.</div>
