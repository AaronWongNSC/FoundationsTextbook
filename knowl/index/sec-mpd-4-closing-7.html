<div class="para"> Notice that the overall process is unchanged, and itâ€™s just a matter of using different numbers. This is very similar to the process of learning to treat variables like numbers in other calculations, such as reducing fractions. In fact, the particular area of mathematical thinking, which is sometimes called <dfn class="terminology">algebraic reasoning</dfn>, is the whole idea that you can generalize the methods and ideas of simple examples so that they can be applied in more complex situations. You got a hint of this type of reasoning in the last few problems where you had to do a mental manipulation before putting the numbers into the parts of a whole framework. And that is the skill that you should be aiming to develop in your college level courses. You want to be more than a calculator.</div>
