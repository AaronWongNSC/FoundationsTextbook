<div class="para"> This framework for the absolute value should remind you of some of the ideas we used when we were working with subtraction. In fact, we can use this to define the distance between two points. The <em class="emphasis">distance</em> between the numbers <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(|b - a|\text{.}\)</span> Notice that this has the same value as <span class="process-math">\(|a - b|\text{.}\)</span> You will see both definitions used, but the first definition draws a better connection between distance and displacement. In fact, sometimes distance is simply defined to be the absolute value of the displacement, and youâ€™re just expected to know how to compute the displacement.</div>
