<div class="para"> Without telling you, there were two types of modeling that were introduced in the last couple worksheets. These are known as <dfn class="terminology">interpolation</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">extrapolation</dfn>. The basic idea of interpolation means to fill in data points	between existing data points. (See <a href="chapter-lines-and-plane.html#sec-lcp-5-deeper" class="internal" title="Section 12.5: Going Deeper: Graphing Functions">Section 12.5</a>.) Extrapolation means modeling data beyond the existing data points. Linear equations are often used for models of these types. It’s usually more complicated because real life data rarely ever fits exactly on a line, so you have to go through a process of finding the "best" line that matches the data, but that application will have to wait for a science or business course.</div>
