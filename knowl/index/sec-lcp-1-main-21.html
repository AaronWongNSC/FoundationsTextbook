<div class="para"> We can generalize the idea of giving locations as the intersection of two lines by allowing ourselves to use curves. For example, locations on the earth are found as the intersection of the latitude and longitude lines (which are actually curves on the globe). Your location in a city can often be described as being near the intersection of two streets (which may not be straight). In trigonometry, there’s another coordinate grid that’s built around circles and lines pointing out from the origin called polar coordinates.</div>
