<div class="para"> Sets of these types are known as <dfn class="terminology">intervals</dfn>. They play an important role in understanding and describing functions and other mathematical objects. We have seen that we can describe intervals using diagrams and inequalities, and it turns out that there is one more method that we use, which is known as <dfn class="terminology">interval notation</dfn>. The value of interval notation is that it allows us to describe an interval using symbols, but without introducing a variable. When talking about a number between and it’s not necessarily helpful for us to arbitrarily pick a symbol to represent that quantity. This is especially true for more complicated situations where we’re already working with several other variables.</div>
