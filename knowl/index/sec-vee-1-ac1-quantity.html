</h4>  <div class="para">What does it mean for a variable to represent a quantity in an expression? One way to think about it is that it’s a calculation waiting to happen. Consider the expression <span class="process-math">\(2x\text{.}\)</span> This represents a number, but which number it represents depends on the value of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> As soon as I give you a value for <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> you can plug it in and give me a specific number. But until then, this is just a number that is waiting to be calculated. For example, if you know that <span class="process-math">\(x = 4\text{,}\)</span> then you can calculate that <span class="process-math">\(2x = 8\text{.}\)</span> We can write this as an English sentence:</div> <aside class="aside aside-like"><div class="para">It turns out that the if-then construction is at the core of basically our entire process of logical reasoning. You will see it in a wide range of introductory courses, from an introduction to philosophy to an introduction to computer science. It’s also ubiquitous in mathematics, though at this level we don’t bring much attention to it.</div></aside><div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\text{If $x = 4$, then $2x = 8$.}

<div class="para">Notice that we’re not saying that <span class="process-math">\(2x\)</span> always has the value of 8. We’re just saying that <em class="emphasis">if</em> <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> takes the value of 4, <em class="emphasis">then</em> the value of <span class="process-math">\(2x\)</span> must be 8.</div> <aside class="aside aside-like"><div class="para">Writing in complete sentences helps you to think in complete ideas. You may not be used to writing sentences in math classes, but math is much more about being able to understand and explain ideas than just executing calculations.</div></aside> <div class="para"><em class="alert">Try it!</em></div> <div class="para">Determine the value of <span class="process-math">\(2x\)</span> when <span class="process-math">\(x = 5\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x = 12\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x = -3\text{.}\)</span> Write your results as if-then statements.</div> <details class="solution solution-like born-hidden-knowl"><summary class="knowl__link"><span class="type">Solution</span><span class="period">.</span></summary><div class="solution solution-like knowl__content"><div class="para logical"><div class="displaymath process-math">
