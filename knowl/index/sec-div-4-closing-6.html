<div class="para"> As you continue onward in your college level mathematics, you may start to see further hints of this idea. For example, in the study of <dfn class="terminology">logarithms</dfn>, you’ll see that the primary relationship is between addition and multiplication, and the relationship between subtraction and division turns out to be nothing more than a fancy way of rewriting that relationship. Those calculations are included below. It’s okay if you do not really understand it right now. Just focus on the relationships between addition and multiplication and how they relate to the relationships between subtraction and division.</div>
