<div class="para"> This shows us that addition and multiplication are the fundamental operations on numbers. In some ways, this may help to explain why addition is easier than subtraction and why multiplication is easier than division. Some operations are just more basic and more fundamental than others. These ideas are also at the core of an area of mathematics known as <dfn class="terminology">field theory</dfn>, which is built on many of the ideas that weâ€™ve already encountered. So it turns out that high level mathematics has its roots in things that we teach to all students.</div>
